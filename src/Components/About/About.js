              I am a Madrilenian based in Bristol. <br /> I originally studied
              Primary Teaching and specialised in Autism Spectrum Disorder.{' '}
              <br />
              For the past five years I have worked as a SEND Tutor with people
              with limited communication and special educational needs, and I
              developed a passion for inclusion and accessibility. <br />I
              discovered programming last year through some online tutorials,
              which led me to enroll on a short course at the City of Bristol
              College, where I learnt the basics of Python. I wanted to learn
              more and after I decided to change careers and start from zero in
              another field I looked for bootcamps (didn't have any time to
              lose!). <br />I am one of the lucky people that studied with the
              School of Code, where I have learnt JavaScript, CSS, HTML,
              TypeScript, React, agile team working skills. <br />
              My experience makes me aware of the needs of people that might not
              have the voice to give feedback. <br />
              Therefore, I believe I can make a difference towards making sites
              more accessible to the broad spectrum of potential users. Feel
              free to take a look into my portfolio and if you like my work
              contact me on Linkedin, Twitter or Github.
